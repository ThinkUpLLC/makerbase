		<h2 class="style-bubblegum">Who is Makerbase for?</h2>
		<p>Makerbase is a useful reference for anyone who's interested in apps and websites and the people behind them. It's particularly valuable for makers, helping everyone discover who creates technology.</p>

		<p>Anyone who makes things on the Internet should be here on Makerbase.</p>

		<h2 class="style-caramel">How do I use Makerbase?</h2>
		<p>Everything in Makerbase <strong>starts with search</strong>. From the homepage, you can type in the search box to find any Maker or Project that you're interested in. Don't see yours? Just click "Create this Maker" or "Create this Project". We'll automatically pull in  information from Twitter or the App Store to fill out the details.</p>
		<p>After that, you can go to any project and add the names of makers who worked on it, with an optional description of what they did and the dates when they did it.</p>
		<p>Makerbase automatically does things like showing you which people a maker tends to collaborate with.</p>
