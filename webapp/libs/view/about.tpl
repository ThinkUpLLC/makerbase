		<h2 class="style-bubblegum"><a href="#who" name="who">Who is Makerbase for?</a></h2>
		<p>Makerbase is a reference for anyone who's interested in apps and web sites and the people behind them. It's particularly valuable for makers and aspiring makers, helping everyone discover who creates technology and the ways they teamed up.</p>

		<p>Anyone who makes things on the internet should be here on Makerbase.</p>

		<h2 class="style-seabreeze"><a href="#use" name="use">How do I use Makerbase?</a></h2>
		<p>Everything in Makerbase <strong>starts with search</strong>. From the homepage, you can type in the search box to find any maker or project that you're interested in. Don't see yours? Just click "Create this Maker" or "Create this Project". Makerbase will automatically pull in information from Twitter or the App Store to fill out the details.</p>
		<p>After that, you can go to any project and add the names of makers who worked on it, with an optional description of what they did and the dates when they did it.</p>
		<p>Makerbase automatically does things like showing you which people a maker tends to collaborate with.</p>

		<h2 class="style-dijon"><a href="#maker" name="maker">Who is a maker?</a></h2>
		<p>A maker is <strong>a human being who has helped build a project</strong> in any way. Makerbase defines "making" broadly, so a project's makers aren't just the coders and founders.</p>

		<p>It’s easy to find out who the founders of an app are, or the editors-in-chief of a site, or the organizers of a conference, or the hosts of a podcast, but not as easy to find out who designed the logo, or managed community, or wrote copy, or was a guest or speaker&mdash;that’s the value Makerbase adds.</p>

		<p>If you contributed in any way to creating a project, you're a maker&mdash;go ahead and add yourself. Anyone else who has helped you build your project is also a maker. The only rule about makers is: a maker is an individual person. Companies, organizations, or brands are not makers.</p>

		<h2 class="style-sandalwood"><a href="#project" name="project">What is a project?</a></h2>
		<p>A project is <strong>a digital work</strong>, like an app, game, web site,  podcast, ebook, video, blog, or art project. Projects don't have to be exclusively digital. Anything that has a digital component&mdash;like programmable hardware, or an event focused on web technology&mdash;count as projects. Companies and brands are not projects, though some projects become companies.</p>
		<p>Projects are not necessarily products, or things makers built at or for work. Makerbase welcomes hobby projects, weekend and nighttime collaborations, and student work or art projects.</p>
		<p>Just like makers, Makerbase uses the term "project" inclusively. If you're not sure if your project qualifies, it probably does&mdash;add it! Makers have listed conferences, books, fundraisers, memes, and networks on Makerbase and they are welcome. The only guidelines are: a human is not a project, and a company is not a project.</p>

		<h2 class="style-caramel"><a href="#fixit" name="fixit">Uh-oh, I see a mistake. How do I fix it?</a></h2>
		<p><strong>Everything on Makerbase can be updated.</strong>  Like Wikipedia, Makerbase is user-editable, which means that anyone can sign in with a Twitter account and add or revise any maker or project or role. If you need to make a change, click on the Edit button and make it.</p>
		<p>If you added a project or maker by accident, click on the Edit button, and then the Archive button. If you accidentally archived something, simply click on the Edit button, then the Unarchive button.</p>
		<p>If you need a page deleted completely from Makerbase, or want to report abuse, click on the Flag button on the relevant page.</p>
