      <p>We&#39;ve tried to make this privacy policy readable because <strong>we really do want you to read it.</strong></p>

    <h2 class="style-seabreeze">We&#39;ll use a few terms in this policy:</h2>

    <dl class="dl-horizontal">
      <dt>&ldquo;Privacy
      Policy&rdquo;:</dt>
      <dd>This policy regarding our privacy practices</dd>

      <dt>&ldquo;ThinkUp&rdquo;,
      &ldquo;we&rdquo;, &ldquo;us&rdquo;, or &ldquo;our&rdquo;:</dt>
      <dd>ThinkUp LLC</dd>

      <dt>&ldquo;Site&rdquo;:</dt>
      <dd>Makerba.se</dd>

      <dt>&ldquo;Services&rdquo;:</dt>
      <dd>Makerba.se, and/or the other domains, products, services, and/or content
      provided by ThinkUp (and its licensors) as part of Makerbase, but not the
      domains, products, services or content provided by ThinkUp as part of its
      services other than Makerbase.</dd>

      <dt>&ldquo;Makerbase&rdquo;:</dt>
      <dd>ThinkUp&#39;s services related to describing projects and those involved in
      projects.</dd>
    </dl>

    <p>This Privacy Policy describes how we treat the information
    we collect when you visit and use any of the Services. When you use any
    of the Services, you are consenting to the collection, transfer, manipulation,
    storage, disclosure and other uses of your information as described in this
    Privacy Policy.</p>

    <p>Because your privacy is important, we ask that you please
    read this Policy carefully. We've also included highlighted annotations
    throughout this policy in quotes; these annotations aren't a part of the policy
    itself, but are intended to help you follow the text and to emphasize key
    sections.</p>

    <h2 class="style-bubblegum">1. Children</h2>

    <h4>&ldquo;We do not collect personally identifiable information
    from children.&rdquo;</h4>

    <p>The Services are not
    directed towards, and ThinkUp does not knowingly collect information from,
    children under the age of thirteen (13). If you are a parent and believe
    your child under the age of thirteen (13) has created a Services account or
    otherwise provided personal information to ThinkUp, please contact us at <a
    href="mailto:help@thinkup.com">help@thinkup.com</a>. </p>

    <h2 class="style-caramel">2. What This Privacy Policy Covers</h2>

    <h4>&ldquo;This Policy covers information you share with ThinkUp,
    not third parties.&rdquo;</h4>

    <p>This Privacy Policy covers our treatment of information
    gathered when you are using or accessing the Services. This Privacy
    Policy does not apply to the practices of third parties that we do not own or
    control, including but not limited to any third party websites, services and
    applications (&ldquo;Third Party Services&rdquo;) that you elect to access through the
    Service or to individuals that we don't manage or employ. We encourage
    you to carefully review the privacy policies of all Third Party Services you
    access.</p>

    <h2 class="style-creamsicle">3. What Information We Collect and How We Use It</h2>

    <h3 class="style-transparent">Information Obtained from Third Party Services:</h3>

    <h4>&ldquo;ThinkUp uses your data shared from third-party networks
    like Twitter and you should understand their policies.&rdquo;</h4>

    <p>Information about Your Accounts on Third Party Services:
    Key parts of the Services require you to link your Account to certain Third Party
    Services, including without limitation social networking services such as
    Twitter. In order to do so, you will provide your user ID and
    authentication on each of those Third Party Services, where we receive a token
    that allows us to access those accounts. We use this authorization as
    permission to, for example, retrieve your activity on those services.</p>

    <p>We do NOT ask for, receive or store your passwords for
    your Third Party Service accounts.</p>

    <p>For your convenience, you can view the Twitter Terms of Service
    here:</p>

    <p><a href="https://twitter.com/tos">https://twitter.com/tos</a></p>

    <p>And you can view the Twitter Privacy Policy here:</p>

    <p><a href="https://twitter.com/privacy">https://twitter.com/privacy</a></p>

    <p>We STRONGLY encourage you to familiarize yourself with the
    terms of service and privacy policy of any Third Party Services which you use
    in conjunction with ThinkUp.</p>

    <p>In some cases, when you connect your Account with your
    accounts on Third Party Services, we may obtain information about you from
    those Third Party Services. Such information could include, for example,
    your gender, if you have disclosed that information to that third party and
    made it available for ThinkUp to access. To the extent we obtain such
    information, we may use the information about you that we receive from Third
    Party Services to improve and personalize our Services. As a general
    practice, we strongly urge you to make careful judgments about any personal
    information you disclose to Internet services, including without limitation ThinkUp
    and any Third Party Services, regardless of whether you choose to link your
    accounts.</p>

    <h3 class="style-transparent">User Content:</h3>

    <h4>&ldquo;Your Makerbase activity is public by default.&rdquo;</h4>

    <p>By default, the information we get from your accounts with
    Third Party Services and the analysis generated by the Services regarding that
    information is public, and it is published so that anyone can view it. If
    you use our Services to edit your profile or someone else&#39;s profile, that edit
    will become public and our Services will publicly show that you made the
    edit. You should assume that anything Makerbase publishes for you is
    publicly accessible unless you have explicitly selected otherwise. Content
    published and shared publicly is accessible to everyone, including without
    limitation search engines. In addition, information shared publicly may
    be copied and shared throughout the Internet. While you are free to
    remove published content from or delete your Account, because of the nature of
    Internet sharing, copies of that content may exist elsewhere and be retained
    indefinitely, including without limitation in our systems.</p>

    <h3 class="style-transparent">Information About User Content:</h3>

    <h4>&ldquo;Your content might have data embedded in it. We may
    use that data.&rdquo;</h4>

    <p>In some cases, we may collect information about content
    you provide to the Services. For example, when it's included with your
    images, we may collect information describing your camera and camera settings,
    or when it is included in your posts on Third Party Services, we may collect
    location information. This information allows us to improve the Services
    and provide additional features and functionality.</p>

    <h3 class="style-transparent">Information Related to Use of the Services:</h3>

    <h4>&ldquo;We use third party statistics and analytics services.
    Read their policies.&rdquo;</h4>

    <p>We collect information about how people use the Services,
    including without limitation those with an Account. This information
    includes general usage information, and may include information such as the
    number and frequency of our visitors, which pages or features of the Services
    they have visited, which links on the Services they have clicked on, and the
    length of those visits. We may also use third party applications and
    services, such as Google Analytics and Chartbeat, to collect and analyze this
    information. This information enables us and third parties authorized by
    us to figure out how often individuals use the Services so that we can analyze
    and improve them. Some of this information may be associated with the IP
    Address (as defined below) used to access the Services, and some may be
    associated with your Account, such as the topics you search for and the help
    pages that you visit. We may also use some of this information in
    aggregate form, that is, as a statistical measure related to all of our users
    that would not identify you personally. We use information about your use
    of the Services to improve and enhance your experience on the Services.</p>

    <p>For your convenience, you may view the Google Analytics
    Terms of Service:</p>

    <p><a href="http://www.google.com/analytics/terms/us.html">http://www.google.com/analytics/terms/us.html</a></p>

    href="http://www.google.com/analytics/learn/privacy.html">http://www.google.com/analytics/learn/privacy.html</a></p>

    <p>Also for your convenience, you may view the Chartbeat
    Terms of Service:</p>

    <p>And this is the Chartbeat Privacy Policy:</p>

    <p><a href="https://chartbeat.com/privacy/">https://chartbeat.com/privacy/</a></p>

    <h3 class="style-transparent">Information Related to Your Web Browser:</h3>

    <h4>&ldquo;Web browsers typically send some data when you visit us;
    We use that to make Makerbase better.&rdquo;</h4>

    <p>We automatically receive and record information from your
    web browser when you interact with the Services, such as your browser type and
    version, what sort of device you are using, your operating system and version,
    your language preference, the website or service that referred you to the
    Services, the date and time of each web request you make, your screen display
    information, and information from any cookies we have placed on your web
    browser (as described below). We also sometimes detect whether you are
    using certain web browser extensions and store that information in a manner
    associated with your Account. Web browser-related information is used to
    enhance your experience with the Services (for example, by personalization) and
    to allow us to improve the Services; it is not, however, used in a manner that
    would identify you personally.</p>

    <h3 class="style-transparent">IP Address Information:</h3>

    <h4>&ldquo;Normally, when you visit Makerbase we receive your IP
    address, which we'll use to improve Makerbase.&rdquo;</h4>

    <p>When you log into the Services or load a web page from the
    Services, we will collect and store your Internet Protocol Address (&ldquo;IP
    Address&rdquo;). We generally use IP Address information to fight spam,
    malware, and identity theft; we also may use it, in the future, to personalize
    the Services for you. IP Address information is also used by us to
    generate aggregate, non-identifying, information about use of the Services.</p>

    <h3 class="style-transparent">Location Information:</h3>

    <h4>&ldquo;If we receive your location information, we'll use it to
    provide better Makerbase services to you.&rdquo;</h4>

    <p>In some cases we collect and store information about where
    you are located, such as by converting your IP Address into a rough geolocation,
    or by using location data stored in photos or in social media messages. We
    may use location information to improve and personalize the Services for you.</p>

    <h3 class="style-transparent">Information Collected Using Cookies:</h3>

    <h4>&ldquo;We use cookies to make Makerbase work for you. If you
    turn them off, you won't be able to use Makerbase. Some statistics
    services we use set cookies, too.&rdquo;</h4>

    <p>Cookies are pieces of text that may be sent to and saved
    by your web browser when you access a website; your web browser stores these
    cookies in a way associated with each website you visit, and you can see your
    cookies through your browser settings. We use cookies to enable our
    servers to recognize your web browser and tell us how and when you use the
    Services. Our cookies do not, by themselves, contain information that
    personally identifies you, and we don't combine the general information
    collected through cookies with other information to tell us who you are. However,
    we do use cookies to identify that you have logged in and that your web browser
    has accessed aspects of the Services, and we may associate that information
    with your Account if you have one. This information, in turn, is
    sometimes used to personalize your experiences on the Services, such as by
    presenting you with a different feature when you are logged in to ThinkUp.
    Most web browsers have an option for turning off the cookie feature, which will
    prevent your browser from accepting new cookies, as well as (depending on your
    web browser software) allowing you to decide to accept each new cookie in a
    variety of ways. If you disable cookies, you won't be able to log into
    your Account, and so will not be able to use the vast majority of our Services;
    as such, we don't recommend disabling your cookies when using the Services.
    Some third-party services that we use, such as Google Analytics and Chartbeat,
    may also place their own cookies on your browser. Note that this Privacy
    Policy covers our use of cookies only and does not cover the use of cookies by
    third parties.</p>

    <p>We do not currently recognize or respond to
    browser-initiated Do Not Track signals as there is no industry standard for
    compliance.</p>

    <h3 class="style-transparent">Information About Your Contacts:</h3>

    <h4>&ldquo;Makerbase automatically retrieves your friend or follower
    list from connected services.&rdquo;</h4>

    <p>Certain features of the Services allow you to provide us
    with your contact lists stored on other services. We only use and store
    that information to provide the Makerbase service to you.</p>

    <h3 class="style-transparent">Derived Information:</h3>

    <h4>&ldquo;We may deduce information about you from your activity.
    We only do that to provide Makerbase services to you.&rdquo;</h4>

    <p>We analyze your actions on the Services in order to derive
    or infer characteristics that may be descriptive of you. These
    characteristics are used to improve and personalize the Services.</p>

    <h3 class="style-transparent">Email Tracking:</h3>

    <h4>&ldquo;We may sometimes put a tracking link in emails to know if
    you opened an email or clicked on a link in it.&rdquo;</h4>

    <p>We may place information in our emails to you (such as a
    web beacon) that allows us to measure our email deliverability, and we may
    track which links in an email are followed. We also use the third-party
    email services MailChimp and Mandrill to deliver messages and you should review
    the policies of these services which govern these messages as well.</p>

    <h2 class="style-dijon">4. Remarketing</h2>

    <h4>&ldquo;You may see more advertising for Makerbase when you
    browse the web.&rdquo;</h4>

    <p>We may use marketing services provided by Google and other
    third parties that allow us to deliver advertising to users after they leave
    our Services that they will see elsewhere on the web. This is a common
    practice called &ldquo;remarketing.&rdquo; Users will not see more ads than they otherwise
    would see as a result of remarketing; rather, the ads they see are more likely
    to be ads for Makerbase products and services. Google (and any other
    third party marketing services providers we use to help us with remarketing) use
    cookies as part of the remarketing service. For more information
    regarding remarketing and the ability to opt-out, please visit:</p>

    <p><a href="http://www.aboutads.info/">http://www.aboutads.info</a></p>

    <h2 class="style-mint">5. With Whom Your Information Is Shared</h2>

    <h4>&ldquo;We don't share your personal information without telling
    you.&rdquo;</h4>

    <p>We never share personal information we receive from you
    unless:</p>

    <p>(a) we have your permission to share that information;</p>

    <p>(b) we have given you prior notice (such as within this
    privacy policy) that the information will be shared, and with whom; or</p>

    <p>(c) that information is aggregate information or other
    information that does not identify you.</p>

    <h3 class="style-transparent">Information Shared with the Public Through the Services:</h3>

    <h4>&ldquo;Your Makerbase contributions are public by default.&rdquo;</h4>

    <p>As noted above, by default, content published through the Services
    is shared with the public, and this is an important feature of the Services.
    Such information includes, but isn't limited to, anything you choose to post on
    or submit to a connected service and anything apparent in a posted photograph.
    Because this kind of information can be seen by anyone and may be indexed by
    search engines (like Google), you should be careful in what you choose to
    disclose publicly and make sure it is information you want to share with
    everyone.</p>

    <h3 class="style-transparent">Information Shared Between the Services:</h3>

    <h4>&ldquo;We might combine your use of different networks together
    to improve Makerbase.&rdquo;</h4>

    <p>We may, if possible, aggregate information about your use
    of multiple Services and use that consolidated information to improve how the
    Services operate, and to develop new Services.</p>

    <h3 class="style-transparent">Information Shared with Our Agents in Order to Operate and Improve the
    Services:</h3>

    <h4>&ldquo;If we hire a contractor or consultant, they'll follow the
    same policy here.&rdquo;</h4>

    <p>In some cases, we share information that we store (such as
    IP Addresses) with third parties, such as our service providers, consultants
    and other agents (&ldquo;Agents&rdquo;), for the purposes of operating and improving the
    Services. For example, we may share information with service providers in
    order to fight spam, and third-party consultants may have access to information
    in the process of improving our processes and technology. Agents with
    whom we share such information for these reasons are generally bound by
    confidentiality obligations and, unless we tell you differently, our Agents do not
    have any right to use information we share with them beyond the scope and
    duration of what is necessary to assist us. You hereby consent to our
    sharing of your information with our Agents.</p>

    <h3 class="style-transparent">Information Shared with Third Parties:</h3>

    <h4>&ldquo;If we share information with business partners, it would
    be aggregate information.&rdquo;</h4>

    <p>We may share or disclose non-private information,
    information that is aggregated with information relating to other Service user
    that does not personally identify you, or other non-personally identifiable
    Information with people and entities that we do business with.</p>

    <h3 class="style-transparent">Information Disclosed Pursuant to Business Transfers:</h3>

    <h4>&ldquo;If we sell Makerbase or its assets, your information
    would come along in the sale.&rdquo;</h4>

    <p>In some cases, we may choose to buy or sell business
    assets. In these transactions, user information is typically one of the
    transferred business assets. Moreover, if we, or substantially all of our
    assets, were acquired, or if we go out of business or enter bankruptcy, user
    information would be one of the assets that is transferred or acquired by a
    third party. You acknowledge that such transfers may occur, and that any
    acquirer of us or our assets may continue to use your personal information as
    set forth in this policy.</p>

    <h3 class="style-transparent">Information Disclosed for Our Protection and the Protection of Others:</h3>

    <h4>&ldquo;We will disclose information if needed to obey the law or
    to protect people.&rdquo;</h4>

    <p>We believe in freedom of expression, and, to the extent
    reasonable, we try to protect our community from baseless legal demands. That
    said, we also reserve the right to access, preserve, and disclose any
    information as we reasonably believe is necessary, in our sole discretion, to
    (i) satisfy any law, regulation, legal process, governmental request, or
    governmental order, (ii) enforce this Privacy Policy and our Terms of Service,
    including without limitation investigation of potential violations hereof,
    (iii) detect, prevent, or otherwise address fraud, security, or technical
    issues (including exchanging information with other companies and organizations
    for fraud protection and spam/malware prevention), (iv) respond to user support
    requests, or (v) protect the rights, property, health, or safety of us, our
    users, any third parties, or the public in general, including but not limited
    to situations involving possible violence, suicide, or self-harm.</p>

    <h3 class="style-transparent">Information We Share with Your Consent or at Your Request:</h3>

    <h4>&ldquo;If you want to share your data, we'll accommodate you.&rdquo;</h4>

    <p>If you ask us to release information that we have about
    your Account, we will do so if reasonable and not unduly burdensome.</p>

    <h2 class="style-pea">6. The Security of Your Information</h2>

    <h4>&ldquo;We're keeping your data reasonably safe.&rdquo;</h4>

    <p>Your Account information is protected by a password for
    your privacy and security. You need to prevent unauthorized access to your
    Account and personal information by selecting and protecting your password
    appropriately and limiting access to your computer and browser by signing off
    after you have finished accessing your Account on the Services.</p>

    <p>We use reasonable measures to protect your information
    (including your Account information) to ensure that it is kept private;
    however, we can't guarantee the security of any information. Unauthorized
    entry or use, hardware or software failure, and other factors, may compromise
    the security of user information at any time.</p>

    <h2 class="style-purple">7. What Information You Can Access</h2>

    <h4>&ldquo;You can see your account information in your Settings
    page.&rdquo;</h4>

    <p>If you are a registered user, you can access and delete
    most information associated with your Account by logging into the Services and
    checking your Account Settings page. Registered and unregistered users
    can access and delete cookies through their web browser settings.</p>

    <p>Your California Privacy Rights: Under California Civil
    Code sections 1798.83-1798.84, California residents are entitled to ask us for
    a notice identifying the categories of personal customer information that we
    share with our affiliates and/or third parties for marketing purposes, and
    providing contact information for such affiliates and/or third parties. If
    you are a California resident and would like a copy of this notice, please
    submit a written request to the following address: 220 East 23rd Street,
    Suite 601, New York, NY 10010.</p>

    <h2 class="style-salmon">8. How to Delete Your Account and What Happens When You Delete Your Account</h2>

    <h4>&ldquo;You can <a
    href="mailto:help@makerba.se">email us</a> to close
    your account, and we'll delete your account. Some information may persist
    for a while after your account is deleted.&rdquo;</h4>

    <p>If you want to delete your Account, you can do so from
    your Membership page or by emailing us at help@thinkup.com and providing proof
    of authority over the Account. What constitutes &ldquo;proof of authority&rdquo; will
    vary depending on the circumstances, but generally will require sufficient
    identifying information so that we can be confident you are the Account owner.
    Deleting your Account does not remove the content you have published from our
    systems and we may continue to use the content in accordance with our Terms of
    Service. In addition, given the nature of sharing on the Services, the
    public activity on your Account prior to deletion may remain stored on our
    servers and accessible to the public. Even after you delete your Account,
    a page may remain which describes you.</p>

    <h2 class="style-sandalwood">Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>

    <h4>&ldquo;We may change this privacy policy. If we do, we'll
    tell you.&rdquo;</h4>

    <p>We may amend this Privacy Policy from time to time, using
    the process for modifications set forth in our Terms of Service. Use of
    information we collect now is subject to the current version of our Privacy Policy
    regardless of when we collected the information. </p>

    <h2 class="style-sepia">Where to Direct Questions or Concerns</h2>

    <h4>&ldquo;Seriously: If you have any questions or concerns about
    this policy, email us.&rdquo;</h4>

    <p>If you have any questions or concerns regarding privacy
    using the Services, please send us a detailed message to help@thinkup.com.</p>
