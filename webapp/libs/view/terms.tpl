      demands, and/or damages (actual and consequential) of every kind and nature,
      known and unknown, arising out of or in any way connected with the
      following:</p>
      <ul>
      <li>Disputes between Subscribers, including those between you and other
      Subscribers.</li>
      <li>Third party sites and services, including content found on such sites

      </ul>
      <p>You hereby waive applicability of California Civil Code §1542, and any
      similar statute or principle of common law. California Civil Code §1542 says:
      &ldquo;A general release does not extend to claims which the creditor does not
      know or suspect to exist in his or her favor at the time of executing the
      release, which if known by him or her must have materially affected his or
      her settlement with the debtor.&rdquo;
      <h3 class="hc">9. Limitation of Liability</h3>
      <blockquote>
      &ldquo;As much as the law allows, ThinkUp and its team isn&#39;t liable for certain
      types of damages. ThinkUp&#39;s total liability to you is limited, too.&rdquo;
      </blockquote>
      <p>TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, THINKUP, ITS DIRECTORS,
      OFFICERS, MEMBERS, EMPLOYEES, REPRESENTATIVES, CONSULTANTS, AGENTS,
      SUPPLIERS, LICENSORS, AND/OR DISTRIBUTORS SHALL NOT BE LIABLE FOR: (A) ANY
      INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, EXEMPLARY PUNITIVE, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES OF ANY
      KIND WHATSOEVER; (B) LOSS OF: PROFITS, REVENUE, DATA, USE, GOOD-WILL, OR
      OTHER INTANGIBLE LOSSES; (C) DAMAGES RELATING TO YOUR INABILITY TO ACCESS OR
      USE THE SERVICES; (D) DAMAGES RELATING TO ANY CONDUCT OR CONTENT OF ANY THIRD
      PARTY OR SUBSCRIBER USING THE SERVICES, INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION,
      DEFAMATORY, OFFENSIVE OR ILLEGAL CONDUCT OR CONTENT; AND/OR (E) DAMAGES IN
      ANY MANNER RELATING TO ANY SUBSCRIBER CONTENT. THIS LIMITATION APPLIES TO ALL
      CLAIMS, WHETHER BASED ON WARRANTY, CONTRACT, TORT, OR ANY OTHER LEGAL THEORY,
      WHETHER OR NOT THINKUP HAS BEEN INFORMED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGE,
      AND FURTHER WHERE A REMEDY SET FORTH HEREIN IS FOUND TO HAVE FAILED ITS
      ESSENTIAL PURPOSE.</p>
      <p>TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, THE TOTAL LIABILITY OF
      THINKUP AND ITS DIRECTORS, OFFICERS, MEMBERS, EMPLOYEES, REPRESENTATIVES,

      <blockquote>
      &ldquo;We follow the law of your region in regard to warranties and liabilities.&rdquo;
      </blockquote>
      <p>Some jurisdictions may not allow the exclusion of certain warranties or the
      exclusion/limitation of liability as set forth in Section 12, so the
      limitations above may not apply to you.</p>
      <h3 class="hc">11. Legal Compliance; Indemnification</h3>
      <blockquote>
      &ldquo;You won&#39;t use Makerbase to do illegal things.&rdquo;
      </blockquote>
      <p>As a condition of your use of the Services, you represent and warrant that
      you will not use the Services for any purpose that is unlawful or prohibited
      by this Agreement. Access to the Services from territories where their
      contents are illegal is strictly prohibited. You agree to comply with all
      rules, laws, and regulations relating in any way to your use of the Services
      including, without limitation, rules about intellectual property rights, the
      Internet, technology, data, email and privacy.</p>
      <p>You agree to indemnify and hold ThinkUp, and its directors, officers,
      members, employees, representatives, consultants, agents, suppliers,
      licensors and/or distributors, harmless from and against any demands,
      suits, actions, claims, losses, damages, liabilities, judgments,
      settlements, costs or expenses, including attorney&rsquo;s fees, arising out of or
      relating to your use or misuse of the Services, violation of this Agreement
      or violation of the rights of any other person or entity.</p>

      party. ThinkUp may also terminate or suspend your access to or ability to use
      any and all Services immediately, without prior notice or liability, for any
      reason or no reason, including but not limited to if you breach any of the
      terms or conditions of this Agreement. In particular, ThinkUp may immediately
      terminate or suspend Accounts that have been flagged for repeat copyright
      infringement.</p>
      <p>Upon termination of your access to or ability to use a Service, including
      but not limited to suspension of your Account on a Service, your right to
      use or access that Service and any Content will immediately cease. All
      provisions of this Agreement which by their nature should survive
      termination shall survive termination, including, without limitation,
      ownership provisions, warranty disclaimers, and limitations of liability.
      Termination of your access to and use of the Services shall not relieve you
      of any obligations arising or accruing prior to such termination or limit
      any liability which you otherwise may have to ThinkUp or any third party.</p>
      <h3 class="hc">13. Arbitration</h3>
      <blockquote>
      &ldquo;If there&#39;s a dispute, we&#39;ll arbitrate instead of going to court.&rdquo;
      </blockquote>
      <p>&ldquo;We will arbitrate certain disputes instead of going to court.&rdquo;
      Any claim where the total amount of the award sought by either you or ThinkUp
      is less than $10,000 shall be resolved via binding non-appearance-based
      arbitration initiated through the American Arbitration Association (&ldquo;AAA&rdquo;).
      The AAA Rules are available online at www.adr.org or by calling the AAA at
      1-800-778-7879. In any such arbitration, the parties and AAA must comply
      with the following rules: (a) the arbitration shall be conducted by
      telephone, online and/or be solely based on written submissions, the specific
      manner shall be chosen by the party initiating the arbitration; (b) the
      arbitration shall not involve any personal appearance by the parties or
      witnesses unless otherwise mutually agreed by the parties; (c) the arbitrator
      may award injunctive or declaratory relief only in favor of the individual
      party seeking relief and only to the extent necessary to provide relief
      warranted by that party&#39;s individual claim; and (d) any judgment on the award
      rendered by the arbitrator may be entered in any court of competent
      jurisdiction. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement, (1) either party
      may seek remedies in small claims court of competent jurisdiction and (2)
      either party may seek injunctive or other equitable relief in any court of
      competent jurisdiction.</p>
      <h3 class="hc">14. Jurisdiction</h3>
      <blockquote>
      &ldquo;This agreement is covered by New York law.  If there is a dispute between us
      not subject to arbitration, we&#39;ll handle it in New York.&rdquo;
      </blockquote>

      <blockquote>
      &ldquo;We&#39;re in the United States, so we&#39;ll follow U.S. law.&rdquo;

      <p>ThinkUp provides global products and services and enables a global community

      located outside of the United States: (1) you consent to the transfer,
      storage, and processing of your information, including but not limited to
      Subscriber Content and any personal information, to and in the United States

      embargoed by the United States, or are on the United States Treasury
      Department&#39;s list of &ldquo;Specially Designated Nationals,&rdquo; you agree that you

      ThinkUp with respect to the subject matter hereof. This Agreement replaces
      all prior or contemporaneous understandings or agreements, written or oral,
      regarding the subject matter hereof and constitutes the entire and exclusive
      agreement between the parties. The failure of either party to exercise in any
      respect any right provided for herein shall not be deemed a waiver of any
      further rights hereunder. If any provision of this Agreement is found to be
      unenforceable or invalid, that provision shall be limited or eliminated to
      the minimum extent necessary so that this Agreement shall otherwise remain in
      full force and effect and enforceable. This Agreement is not assignable,
      transferable, or sublicensable by you except with ThinkUp&#39;s prior written
      consent. ThinkUp may assign this Agreement in whole or in part at any time
      without your consent. No agency, partnership, joint venture, or employment is
      created as a result of this Agreement and you do not have any authority of
      any kind to bind ThinkUp in any respect whatsoever. Any notice to ThinkUp
      that is required or permitted by this Agreement shall be in writing and
