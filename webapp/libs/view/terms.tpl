      <h1>Makerbase Terms of Service</h1>
      <h4>Last Modified: <strong>2015-07-30</strong></h4>
      <p>Hi and welcome! You are now reading
      Makerbase's Terms of Service, which include an agreement between you
      and ThinkUp in Section 15 to arbitrate in certain cases instead of going to
      court.</p>

      <p>This is the legal contract between you
      and ThinkUp when you use the Makerbase site, and related services and products.
      You should read this carefully before you use our site, our services or
      products.</p>

      <p>We've tried to be both fair and clear&mdash;if you have any
      suggestions for improvement, feel free to email us at <a href="mailto:help@makerba.se">help@makerba.se</a>. We've also included annotations throughout this contract in quotes; these annotations
      aren't a part of the contract itself, but are intended to help you follow the
      text and to emphasize key sections.</p>

    </div>

    <h2 class="style-purple">7. Warranty Disclaimer; Services Available on an &ldquo;AS-IS&rdquo; Basis</h2>

    <h4>&ldquo;We want Makerbase to be great for you, but it's not
    warrantied.&rdquo;</h4>

    <p>YOUR ACCESS TO AND USE OF THE SERVICES OR ANY CONTENT IS
    AT YOUR OWN RISK. THE SERVICES AND ANY ANALYTICS PROVIDED THROUGH THE
    SERVICES ARE PROVIDED FOR INFORMATION PURPOSES ONLY AND THINKUP IS NOT
    RESPONSIBLE OR LIABLE FOR ANY ACTIONS OR OMISSIONS BASED ON SUCH ANALYTICS.
    YOU UNDERSTAND AND AGREE THAT THE SERVICES ARE PROVIDED TO YOU ON AN &ldquo;AS IS&rdquo;
    AND &ldquo;AS AVAILABLE&rdquo; BASIS. WITHOUT LIMITING THE FOREGOING, TO THE FULL
    EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, THINKUP DISCLAIMS ALL WARRANTIES, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING
    WITHOUT LIMITATION WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR
    PURPOSE, OR NON-INFRINGEMENT. ThinkUp makes no representations or
    warranties of any kind with respect to the Services, including any
    representation or warranty that the use of the Services will (a) be timely,

    herein.</p>

    <h2 class="style-salmon">8. Release From Liability</h2>

    <h4>&ldquo;We're not liable for certain issues that could arise from
    using Makerbase.&rdquo;</h4>

    <p>You release, to the fullest extent permitted by law,
    ThinkUp, its directors, officers, members, employees, representatives,
    consultants, agents, suppliers, and/or distributors from responsibility,
    liability, claims, demands, and/or damages (actual and consequential) of every
    kind and nature, known and unknown, arising out of or in any way connected with
    the following:</p>

    /span>Disputes
    between or among Subscribers, including without limitation those between you

    /span>Claims
    relating to the unauthorized access to any data communications or Subscriber

    <p>You hereby waive applicability of California Civil Code
    ¤1542, and any similar statute or principle of common law. California
    Civil Code ¤1542 says: &ldquo;A general release does not extend to claims which
    the creditor does not know or suspect to exist in his or her favor at the time
    of executing the release, which if known by him or her must have materially
    affected his or her settlement with the debtor.&rdquo;</h4>

    <h2 class="style-sandalwood">9. Limitation of Liability</h2>

    <h4>&ldquo;As much as the law allows, ThinkUp and its team isn't
    liable for certain types of damages. ThinkUp's total liability to you is
    limited, too.&rdquo;</h4>

    <p>TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW,
    THINKUP, ITS DIRECTORS, OFFICERS, MEMBERS, EMPLOYEES, REPRESENTATIVES,
    CONSULTANTS, AGENTS, SUPPLIERS, LICENSORS, AND/OR DISTRIBUTORS SHALL NOT BE
    LIABLE FOR: (A) ANY INCIDENTAL, EXEMPLARY, PUNITIVE, CONSEQUENTIAL OR
    OTHER INDIRECT DAMAGES OF ANY KIND WHATSOEVER; (B) LOSS OF PROFITS, REVENUE,
    DATA, USE, GOOD-WILL, OR OTHER INTANGIBLE LOSSES; (C) DAMAGES RELATING TO YOUR
    INABILITY TO ACCESS OR USE THE SERVICES; (D) DAMAGES RELATING TO ANY CONDUCT OR
    CONTENT OF ANY THIRD PARTY OR SUBSCRIBER USING THE SERVICES, INCLUDING WITHOUT
    LIMITATION DEFAMATORY, OFFENSIVE OR ILLEGAL CONDUCT OR CONTENT; AND/OR (E)
    DAMAGES IN ANY MANNER RELATING TO ANY SUBSCRIBER CONTENT. THIS LIMITATION
    APPLIES TO ALL CLAIMS, WHETHER BASED ON WARRANTY, CONTRACT, TORT, OR ANY OTHER
    LEGAL THEORY, WHETHER OR NOT THINKUP HAS BEEN INFORMED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF
    SUCH DAMAGE, AND FURTHER WHERE A REMEDY SET FORTH HEREIN IS FOUND TO HAVE
    FAILED ITS ESSENTIAL PURPOSE.</p>

    <p>TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, THE
    TOTAL LIABILITY OF THINKUP AND ITS DIRECTORS, OFFICERS, MEMBERS, EMPLOYEES,
    REPRESENTATIVES, CONSULTANTS, AGENTS, SUPPLIERS, LICENSORS AND/OR DISTRIBUTORS,
    FOR ANY CLAIM UNDER THIS AGREEMENT, INCLUDING FOR ANY IMPLIED WARRANTIES, IS
    LIMITED TO THE GREATER OF FIFTY DOLLARS (US$50.00) OR THE AMOUNT YOU PAID US TO
    USE THE APPLICABLE SERVICE(S) IN THE TWELVE (12) MONTHS IMMEDIATELY PRECEDING
    THE EVENTS GIVING RISE TO THE CLAIM.</p>

    <h2 class="style-seabreeze">10. Exclusions
    to Warranties and Limitation of Liability</h2>

    <h4>&ldquo;We follow the law of your region in regard to warranties
    and liabilities.&rdquo;</h4>

    <p>Some jurisdictions may not allow the exclusion of certain
    warranties or the exclusion/limitation of liability as set forth in Section 9,
    so the limitations above may not apply to you.</p>

    <h2 class="style-sepia">11. Legal
    Compliance; Indemnification</h2>

    <h4>&ldquo;You won't use Makerbase to do illegal things.&rdquo;</h4>

    <p>As a condition of your use of the Services, you represent
    and warrant that you will not use the Services for any purpose that is unlawful
    or prohibited by this Agreement. Access to the Services from territories
    where their contents are illegal is strictly prohibited. You agree to
    comply with all rules, laws, and regulations relating in any way to your use of
    the Services including without limitation rules about intellectual property
    rights, the Internet, technology, data, email, and privacy.</p>

    <p>You agree to indemnify and hold ThinkUp, and its
    directors, officers, members, employees, representatives, consultants, agents,
    suppliers, licensors and/or distributors, harmless from and against any
    demands, suits, actions, claims, losses, damages, liabilities, judgments,
    settlements, costs or expenses, including without limitation attorneys&apos; fees,
    arising out of or relating to your use or misuse of the Services, violation of
    this Agreement or violation of the rights of any other person or entity.</p>

    <h2 class="style-bubblegum">12. Termination</h2>

    <h4>&ldquo;If you want to cancel this agreement, just close your Account.
    We can cancel it too.&rdquo;</h4>

    <p>Either party may terminate this Agreement at any time by
    notifying the other party. ThinkUp may also terminate or suspend your
    access to or ability to use any and all Services immediately, without prior
    notice or liability, for any reason or no reason, including but not limited to
    if you breach any of the terms or conditions of this Agreement. ThinkUp
    may immediately terminate or suspend Accounts that have been flagged for repeat
    copyright infringement.</p>

    <p>Upon termination of your access to or ability to use a
    Service, including but not limited to suspension of your Account on a Service,
    your right to use or access that Service and any Content will immediately cease.
    The following Sections shall survive any termination of these Terms of
    Service: 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, and 17. Termination
    of your access to and use of the Services shall not relieve you of any
    obligations arising or accruing prior to such termination or limit any
    liability which you otherwise may have to ThinkUp or any third party.</p>

    <h2 class="style-caramel">13. Arbitration;
    Waiver of Class Actions</h2>

    <h4>&ldquo;We&apos;ll arbitrate instead of going to court for many
    disputes. We&apos;ll only resolve disputes on an individual basis.&rdquo;</h4>

    <p>Any claim where (a) the total amount of the award sought
    by either you or ThinkUp is less than $10,000 and (b) that does not involve
    paten, copyrights, trademarks, trade secrets or moral rights, shall be resolved
    via binding non-appearance-based arbitration initiated through the American
    Arbitration Association (&ldquo;AAA&rdquo;). The AAA Rules are available online at
    www.adr.org or by calling the AAA at 1-800-778-7879. In any such
    arbitration, the parties and AAA must comply with the following rules: (w)
    the arbitration shall be conducted by telephone, online and/or be solely based
    on written submissions, and the specific manner shall be chosen by the party
    initiating the arbitration; (x) the arbitration shall not involve any personal
    appearance by the parties or witnesses unless otherwise mutually agreed by the
    parties; (y) the arbitrator may award injunctive or declaratory relief only in
    favor of the individual party seeking relief and only to the extent necessary
    to provide relief warranted by that party's individual claim; and (z) any
    judgment on the award rendered by the arbitrator may be entered in any court of
    competent jurisdiction. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement, (1)
    either party may seek remedies in small claims court of competent jurisdiction
    and (2) either party may seek injunctive or other equitable relief in any court
    of competent jurisdiction.</p>

    <p>Any claims brought by you or us must be brought in that
    party&apos;s individual capacity, and not as a plaintiff or class member in any
    purported class or representative proceeding. Neither you nor us will
    participate in a class action or class-wide arbitration for any claims covered
    by these Agreement. You hereby waive any and all rights to bring any claims
    related to these Agreement and/or our <a
    href="https://makerba.se/about/privacy/">Privacy Policy</a> as a plaintiff or
    class member in any purported class or representative proceeding. You may bring
    claims only on your own behalf. </p>

    <p>You may opt out of the agreement to arbitrate in the first
    paragraph of this Section 13 (&ldquo;Agreement to Arbitrate&rdquo;). If you do so, neither
    you nor we can require the other to participate in an arbitration proceeding.
    To opt out, you must notify us in writing within thirty (30) days of the date
    that you first became subject to this arbitration provision. The opt-out notice
    must state that you do not agree to the Agreement to Arbitrate and must include
    your name, address, phone number, your Account to which the opt-out applies and
    a clear statement that you want to opt out of this Agreement to
    Arbitrate. You must sign the opt-out notice for it to be effective. This
    procedure is the only way you can opt out of the Agreement to Arbitrate. You
    must use this address to opt out: </p>

    <p>ThinkUp LLC. ATTN: Arbitration Opt-out, 220 East 23<sup>rd</sup>,
    Suite 601, New York, NY 10010, USA.</p>

    <p>Notwithstanding any provision in this Agreement to the
    contrary, you and we agree that if we make any change to the arbitration procedures
    (other than a change to any notice address or Site link provided herein) in the
    future, that change shall not apply to any claim that was filed in a legal
    proceeding against us prior to the effective date of the change. Moreover,
    if we seek to terminate the arbitration procedures from this Agreement, such
    termination shall not be effective until thirty (30) days after the version of this
    Agreement not containing the arbitration procedures is posted to our Services,
    and shall not be effective as to any claim that was filed in a legal proceeding
    against us prior to the effective date of removal.</p>

    <p>In accordance with Section 12, this Section will survive
    the termination of your relationship with us.</p>

    <h2 class="style-creamsicle">14. Jurisdiction</h2>

    <h4>&ldquo;This agreement is covered by New York law. If there
    is a dispute between us not subject to arbitration, we'll handle it in New
    York.&rdquo;</h4>

    <p>Before resorting to litigation, we strongly encourage you
    to contact us at help@thinkup.com to seek a resolution.</p>

    <p>This Agreement shall be governed in all respects by the
    laws of the State of New York as they apply to agreements entered into and to
    be performed entirely within New York between New York residents, without
    regard to conflict of law provisions. You agree that any claim or dispute
    you may have against ThinkUp that isn&apos;t subject to mandatory arbitration under
    Section 14 must be resolved exclusively by a state or federal court located in
    New York County, New York, except as otherwise agreed by the parties. Each
    party agrees to submit to the personal jurisdiction of the courts located
    within New York County, New York for the purpose of litigating all such claims
    or disputes.</p>

    <h2 class="style-dijon">15. Special
    Provisions for users Located Outside of the United States</h2>

    to users located outside of the United States: (1) you consent to
